# Documenting the steps I am taking to regain my space on the internet

## What and why

The internet is awesome and lovely and fun and all that. However, [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) is real and it is being continuously perpetrated on every platform and every artform that exists. Besides the obvious enshittification, it's the lack of [interoperability](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legislative-path-interoperable-internet) between platforms that really bothers me. There is no reason that I shouldn't be able to interact with an instagram account via twitter besides the fact that they are shitty pieces of software and that they are built to be walled gardens. Here we are on the "information highway" and we can't even interact with each other except in very specific ways as mandated by FAANG, MAAMA, MANGA or whatever they want to call themselves.

I'd love to extract as much of myself as I can from these 'ecosystems' and also find alternative ways to connect with people that are more fun and inclusive.

This a growing document as I experiment with things.

## SDF
The first stop is [SDF](https://sdf.org/), which is just such a cool project. SDF (Super Dimension Fortress) is named after the class of ship from the Macross anime series and this is actually how I found it. My brother and I loved Robotech as kids and as it turns out, Robotech is just the American reskinning of the original SDF Macross. I was looking for stuff about SDF and ended up finding this space inhabited by a bunch of linux nerds having fun. Find out more [here](https://sdf.org/?faq).

In a nutshell, these folks set up a single PC running a BBS in 1987 and then just continued building it up over the years. It is now a much bigger server that offers remote shell access to anyone that wants to be a member. There are different levels of membership that give you different things. Basic access allows you to explore your own home folder on the SDF server, and then higher levels give you more stuff to do (like ssh out of your sdf shell to other places, use commands like ftp or scp for file transfers, carve out a little gopherspace, host a little webpage). There are even higher levels that give you things like a SQL database. Pretty cool stuff. SDF actually ended up becoming my gateway to some of the other things I will talk about here.

## Fediverse
Of course, the obvious paradigm shift. The fediverse is, on paper, the exact thing I am looking for. Interoperable social media spaces that are built on an open protocol. Interest...piqued.
